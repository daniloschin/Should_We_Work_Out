The "Exercise and Fitness Metrics Dataset: Independent Variables and Weight Related Measures" is a comprehensive dataset that captures various factors related to exercise, fitness, and weight management. The dataset includes a range of independent variables along with measurements of dream weight and actual weight.

The exercise variable represents the type of exercise performed, while calories burned denotes the estimated number of calories burnt during the exercise session. Dream weight signifies the desired weight, and actual weight captures the measured weight with some natural variation.

Additional independent variables provide insights into the individuals performing the exercises. Age represents the age of the individuals, and gender indicates their gender (Male or Female). Duration records the length of each exercise session, and heart rate represents the average heart rate during the session. BMI, a commonly used health indicator, offers information about body composition. Weather conditions during exercise sessions are recorded, and exercise intensity provides a rating of the intensity level.
